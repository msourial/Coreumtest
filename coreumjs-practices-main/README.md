## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A development environment set up with Coreum-JS installed (npm i coreum-js).
- Install NextJS 
- A wallet with some testcore tokens for testing purposes (and you mnemonic).

## Workshop Steps

### 1. Send CORE Tokens
In this step, you'll learn how to send CORE tokens from one Coreum address to another. This is a fundamental operation in the Coreum ecosystem.

### 2. Issuing Smart Tokens (FT & NFT)
Discover how to issue both Fungible Tokens (FT) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) using Coreum-JS.

### 3. Minting Smart Tokens
Learn how to mint new Smart Tokens, whether they are FT or NFT.

### 4. Sending Smart Tokens
Explore the process of sending Smart Tokens to other addresses within the Coreum network. Understand how transactions work with these tokens.

### 5. Whitelisting Smart Tokens (NFT)
Dive into the world of NFTs and understand how to whitelist Smart Tokens, making them accessible to specific users / wallet.

### 6. Interacting with a Smart Contract
Finally, discover how to interact with a smart contract using Coreum-JS. This skill is essential for building more complex applications on the Coreum blockchain.
